# docker-tensorflow-cpu
My attempt at making something useful with TensorFlow


If I'm understanding things correctly, give this container a try doing the following:

- Download a bunch of images splitting them by categories, e.g. each category should be a folder
- Train the model by executing:

```
./train.sh /absolute/path/where/you/have/your/subfolders/
```

- Go do something while it's doing its thing, e.g. be productive


TO-DO: more to come
